## Overview
First time interacting with git.
Stumbled upon FrontendMentor on google and decided to give it a go since i need some relevant experience in building projects like this so that i could get ready for an internship or job.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- Desktop-first solution using CSS Flexbox
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

Laying out the basics wasn't too hard but once I started looking at how to do the flexbox and gradients it got more challangeing. Eventualy got it done but the mobile version responsivness was not the greatest since I still don't have the best grasp on it.

### What I learned

The biggest challange for me here was to understand better how flexbox works and get a better grasp on it. Which I certainly did. Another part was the gradient colors which gave me more trouble than I would have liked so i had to do a bit of googling and finding relevant code to use unfortunately. However I do have a better understanding of it especially with the hsla value.


### Continued development

I'm already implementing some parts of this project on another one which im currently working on. Trying to figure out how to do it with css grid and make a review tab, maybe with a pop-up section as well.
